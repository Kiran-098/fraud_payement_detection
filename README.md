Fraud Payment Detection

Fraud Payment Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions in financial systems.
It uses Python, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook (VS Code) for preprocessing, model training, and fraud classification.

🚀 Features

✅ Fraud vs. Legitimate Transaction Classification
✅ Preprocessing Pipeline – Handles missing values and feature transformations
✅ Randomized step Assignment – Assigned internally between 1–95 (user input excluded)
✅ Internal Fraud Flag (isFlaggedFraud) – Handled by the system, not user-provided
✅ Model Training & Evaluation – Machine learning models applied for fraud detection
✅ Jupyter Notebook Development – Interactive analysis and experimentation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
Environment: Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is adapted from public financial transaction datasets (Kaggle / IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection resources). It has been cleaned and structured for model training and evaluation.
